    It is a platform to measure triathletes perfomance based on their races history.

    ## What does athlete's color and level mean? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="level">§</a>

    Level depends on athlete's current TriScore and inspired by [metals melting points

    ## What the hell is that gauge? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="performance-gauge">§</a>

    That is Performance Gauge!
    It shows average percent of age group athletes staying behind a selected one.

    Blue stands for Swim, Green for Bike and Red for Run. Center value is for combined result.

<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces id="formula">
    ## What is the formula behind the TriScore? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="formula">§</a>
    ---
    TriScore based on [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) widely used in
    [chess](https://ratings.fide.com/), computer games
    and other competitive areas.

    Main ideas are:
    - score is an integer number describing level of each athlete
    - initial score is 1500 for every athlete
    - score is calculated by each age group separately
    - probability that athlete A is going to win athlete B:
    `p = 1 / (1 + 10^(score(B) - score(A)) / 400))`

    For example:
    - if A has the same score as B: `p = 1/2`
    - if A has score greater than B on 400: `p = 10/11`
    - if A has score less than B on 400: `p = 1/11`

    For each athlete before each race we calculate the Seed: expected Time Rank he is going to take. Time Rank is not a
    usual discrete number showing how much people faster than you. Time Rank is your relative position between first and
    last athletes in your age group based on finish time.

    After race you have a real Time Rank. The difference of your Seed and your Time Rank called Delta.
    If Delta is positive, your score is growing. Otherwise, it's falling.

    ## Does my TriScore change if I do not participate in new races? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]=""
        fragment="change">§</a>
    ---
    No, for now TriScore describes athlete's level right after his last race. More races you have, more
    precise your score.

<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces id="distance">
    ## How does TriScore Delta depend on the length of triathlon distance? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]=""
        fragment="distance">§</a>
    ---
    Delta is proportional to the length of a distance. Full distance move you clother to your real score twice
    faster than half distance.

<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces id="dnf">
    ## Does score punish for not finishing the race? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="dnf">§</a>
    ---
    Yes, it is always better to finish the race in terms of score. But for lower level athletes DNF is less
    painful than for higher level.

<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces id="upper-bound">
    ## Is there a upper bound for TriScore? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="upper-bound">§</a>

    Theoretically, no.

<markdown ngPreserveWhitespaces id="maximize">
    ## What is the fastest way gain higher TriScore? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="maximize">§</a>
    ---
    You have to overtake as many athletes as you can (thanks, cap). Competing with stronger athletes gives you more
    chances to increase your TriScore since your Seed (see <a [routerLink]="" fragment="formula">formula</a>) is higher compare to week athletes group.

    ## What races are under the hood? <a class="about-link" [routerLink]="" fragment="races">§</a>
    ---
    Rating is calculated based on all official half and full [IRONMAN](https://www.ironman.com/) results. But no
    worries, more races are coming!

    First, try to put your name/surname another way. For example Dmitriy vs Dmitrii vs Дмитрий. If nothing changes, your race result probably not on the official results list.
